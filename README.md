# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game as a way to learn array utilization and game logic. The C++ project also builds upon previous concepts by adding array manipulation into the mix, which is ideal for learning how to manage and use data structures.

Play the classic game:

We represent the game board with a 3x3 matrix. This is built with a vector of vectors of characters.
The drawBoard function displays the current state of the board.
The checkWin function checks if a player has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
The checkDraw function checks for a draw if there are no empty spaces left.
The main function handles the game loop, player input, and alternates turns between players X and O.
The game continues until a player wins or there's a draw.
When you run this C++ program, two players can play by entering the row and column numbers where they want to place their marker (X or O).
